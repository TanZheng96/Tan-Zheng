Let me introduce myself :slightly_smiling_face: I am Tan, as you all coding was my hobby and life style. I met coding at the very beginning of my academic career. Although my department is electronic engineering, I switched to computer engineering department :relieved: And now I have about 6 years of native mobile application development and design experience. I am currently working at DonanÄ±mHaber as an Android developer. Besides I am application consultant at Newark USA LLC. I couldn't spare a lot of time for my personal development due to my busy business life, I think it's time to get more active in Github, follow me :metal:
